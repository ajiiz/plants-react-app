# PlantsPot Website

**PlantsPot** is a website created with **React** framework that allows user to search for plants by the name.
You can also include color of the plant. 
All plants are fetched using **Trefle API**.
Website was made to improve my programming and development skills. Feel free to point out any issues or things I should change to make website much better.
